# 📌 Crime Pattern Prediction using ML & DL

## 🧠 Overview
This project leverages Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to analyze and predict crime patterns in Vancouver. By processing and modeling real-world crime datasets, we uncover spatial and temporal insights while comparing model performance across classical and neural architectures.
